# AbeoVanish

A modular packet-level plugin for Paper (Unsure if Spigot should be supported) which utilises PacketEvents to provide a
tool for hiding players.

## Why AbeoVanish?

AbeoVanish uses the **latest modern technology** to provide a seamless experience for both the player and the server
administration.
It is designed to be as lightweight as possible, and to be as compatible as possible with other plugins.
It is also designed to be as customisable as possible, allowing you to change the plugin to suit your needs.

Also notable features include:

- PacketEvents for packet-level manipulation
- Every message is customisable
- And much more!

Just follow basic contribution guidelines and you should be fine. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
I tried to add many comments explaining what I thought when I wrote to code, mostly so I would remember what I did
myself.
